Patong Beach isn\\'t an idyllic island paradise for travelers looking to recharge.<br/>With a wide coastline, soft white sand, warm water, and plenty of hotels, restaurants, and shopping within walking distance, it’s impossible to get bored here."},{"link":"","name":"Railay Beach, Krabi","image":"thailand/beaches/railay_krabi.jpg","desc":"Clear blue water, small islands on the horizon, and majestic limestone cliffs surround the small beaches which are usually only crowded during Thailand\\'s peak season.<br/>Though it’s technically on the mainland, Railay Beach in Krabi is only accessible by boat and has an isolated island feel you won’t find at most of Thailand\\'s popular beach destinations.<br/>Aside from rock climbing, swimming, and snorkeling, there’s not much else to do here but admire the gorgeous scenery—so bring a book and prepare to relax!"},{"link":"","name":"Maya Bay","image":"thailand/beaches/maya.jpg","desc":"Made famous in the hit movie The Beach, many visitors flock to the bay to walk in Leonardo DiCaprio’s footsteps. While tourism is definitely leaving its mark, there’s no denying that the beach is still stunning. The soft white sands of the curved bay meet clear and sparkling karst-studded waters, with the dense jungle background adding to the visual magic."},{"link":"","name":"Sairee Beach","image":"thailand/beaches/sairee_beach.jpg","desc":"Although only approximately one-mile long, Sairee Beach is the longest stretch of sand on the stunning island of Ko Tao, also sometimes referred to as Turtle Island. Sairee Beach, which is located on the island’s west side, is popular with snorkelers and scuba divers. Although this is a relatively low-key area, it still boasts a number of nightclubs and bars. You can reach the lovely island of Ko Tao either by air or by ferry service."},{"link":"","name":"Hua Hin Beach","image":"thailand/beaches/hua.jpg","desc":"Hua Hin Beach area has been a long-time favorite vacation destination for Thais. Today, this 8 km (5 mile) long beach is also popular with tourists. Hua Hin is the site of the Klai Kangwon Palace, which is still used by Thai royalty today. Not surprisingly, Hua Hin is also a popular vacation destination for rich and famous Thai families. In addition, the Hua Hin beach area, which is located in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, is a golfer’s delight. Currently, it is home to the highest concentration of golf courses in all of Thailand."},{"link":"","name":"Lamai Beach, Koh Samu","image":"thailand/beaches/lamai.jpg","desc":"Clusters of palm trees and turquoise water make Lamai Beach the exotic paradise travelers hope to find. The southern end of the beach is the best and busiest, with the sand eventually tapering down to rocks on the northern end. Unfortunately, a few go-go \"girlie\" bars have set up shop along the road.<br/>For a bizarre break from the sun, have a look inside Wat Khunaram where an esteemed monk\\'s body is mummified and on display (per his request) inside a glass case.<br/>Renting a motorbike is the best way to explore the big island of Koh Samui, but only do so if you\\'re experienced at driving in Asia. The fishing village just a little south, although now catering to tourists, is an interesting diversion.<br/>At night, the scores of bars and restaurants turn Lamai Beach into a party scene that attracts expats and travelers alike."},{"link":"","name":"Phra Nang Beach","image":"thailand/beaches/phra.jpg","desc":"Krabi’s Phra Nang Beach is often ranked among the most beautiful beaches across the globe. Catch a long-tail boat from the party beach of Ao Nang to marvel at the stunning views and soak up the relaxed vibe. The white sands are flanked by towering cliffs, limestone rocks rise majestically from the shimmering waters, and there’s an interesting cave filled with phallus-shaped offerings. Add coral reefs, sea caves, and a sprinkling of food and drink vendors and it’s a veritable tropical beach haven."},{"link":"","name":"Ko Phayam","image":"thailand/beaches/ko_phayam.jpg","desc":"Ko Phayam is just a 45-minute speedboat ride from the port town of Ranong, within easy reach of Bangkok. A little backwater with a tourism industry that’s just starting up, the island is home to just over 500 permanent residents. The friendly local community will welcome you with open arms and those famous Thai smiles.<br/>Two beaches form the main attractions in Ko Phayam. Aow Yai (Big Bay) Beach is where the activities are– from boogie boarding to surfing – while Aow Khao Kwai (Buffalo Bay) is the quieter alternative, surrounded by mangroves and dramatic rock formations.<br/>Other activities include hiking, biking, yoga classes, diving, and scootering around the island’s dusty trails. Eating out is a treat, especially for the diet-conscious, as Ko Phayam boasts a surprisingly good veggie food scene."},{"link":"","name":"Ang Thong Islands","image":"thailand/beaches/ang_thong.jpg","desc":"Ang Thong Islands (Golden Bowl Islands) are a group of isles characterized by limestone cliffs, coral reefs, wild jungle, and white sandy beaches.<br/>With endless waterfalls, hidden coves, and lakes to explore, the islands are a popular hiking, snorkeling, kayaking, and diving destination. Within the national park and the protected waters around it, you’ll find a plethora of creatures and birds, from langurs and otters to sea turtles and little herons.<br/>While most of the smaller islands are off-limits to tourists, some of the larger islands can be visited with a day trip from Ko Samui or Ko Phangan. Explore Ko Paluay, the only inhabited island of the 40-plus archipelago (home to sea gypsies), or Ko Mae (the Mother Island) with its beautiful beach and glorious Emerald Lake.<br/>Have a fresh seafood lunch at a Ko Phaluai, the largest island, discover the coral reef off Ko Sam Sao, and stay overnight in the rustic bungalows at Ko Wua Ta Lap – you won’t regret it."},{"link":"","name":"Ko Chang Noi","image":"thailand/beaches/koh-chang.jpg","desc":"Ko Chang Noi (Elephant Island) in south-western Thailand is one of three Thai islands with the same name. Not to be confused with its bigger namesake in eastern Thailand, this one is located near Ranong in the Andaman Sea.<br/>Granted, this small island is lesser-known than its larger counterpart, but it’s becoming more and more popular amongst adventure travelers – or anyone who can trade in hot water and electricity for the appeal of the wilderness.Offering a true escape, the order of the day in Ko Chang Noi is eat, sleep, explore, repeat. Perfect for couples looking for some time away in nature, or those who appreciate the raw basics, Ko Chang Noi is accessible only by boat and offers rustic ‘resort’ accommodation."},{"link":"","name":"Similan Islands","image":"thailand/beaches/similan_islands.jpg","desc":"The Similan Islands (Nine Islands) are a group of low-lying forested islands located in the Andaman Sea. Forming part of the Mu Koh Similan National Park, the islands are home to a plethora of natural wonders, such as curiously-shaped boulders, white sandy beaches, and dense forests full of wildlife.<br/>Ko Similan is the largest island of the archipelago and a great place to base yourself for exploring the islands’ attractions, such as Sail Rock, Sunset Point, and Similan Viewpoint. Bear in mind that there are no hotels, but you can stay in wooden bungalows and campsites."},{"link":"","name":"Ko Samui","image":"thailand/beaches/ko_samui.jpg","desc":"The main attraction of Ko Samui is the Big Buddha statue at the Wat Phra Yai temple that can be found on an islet connected by a causeway. Rent a scooter and beach hop or visit highlights like Chaweng Beach, Fisherman’s Village Bophut, Wat Plai Laem temple, Grandfather’s Rock, and Tan Rua or Hin Lat Waterfall.<br/>This natural beauty hasn’t escaped the eyes of tourists – you’ll find endless luxury resorts and spas on the island too. Many travelers come here to take advantage of the hedonistic spa treatments available, from traditional Thai massage to yoga retreats, cleansing fasts, tai-chi camps, and chakra-balancing treatments."}]}
