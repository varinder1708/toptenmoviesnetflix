The river has a steep gradient and a greater mass of water, so it rages down in noisy torrents. It is inadvisable to cross the fierce river on foot. There is a rickety old wooden bridge for that.<br/>For a supremely pleasant leisure afternoon stretch out on one of the smooth boulders beside the river with your feet in the cold water. It could be an eternity in an hour or an hour stretching into a lifetime.'

Housing many pilgrimage sites revered by the Sikhs and Hindus, Manikaran is located on the Parvati River. A bath and a visit here are surely some of the best things to do here.'
